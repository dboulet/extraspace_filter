The input filter provided by this module cleans up HTML input, especially that created by visual editors, by removing things such as empty paragraph tags, multiple line-breaks and non-breaking spaces, and other markup which create extra white space.

INSTALLATION
============
Install this module like you would any other with an input filter.
- Enable the module
- Add the extra space filter to a Text format
